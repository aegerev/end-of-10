		"description": "Linux is 100% free to download and use — one of the most compelling reasons to give Linux a try. Moreover, most applications and software for Linux are free, too. You can find great alternatives to your favorite programs, such as LibreOffice for MS Office, or GIMP for Adobe Photoshop. With zero money spent on the OS and apps, you can try Linux risk-free. It also encourages you to play around with different Linux distros to see which one you like best. Some Linux distros do require you to pay, but almost all of them are free."
